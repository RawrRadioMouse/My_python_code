# My_py_and_js_code
to reference tasks I have performed in past,now with added bonus js section as I expend my skillset.

py and js are predominately used in my day to day life for the purpose of fuzzing/building exploits (python) and reviewing code and searching for XSS vectors (js)

# Other tools created from blackhat python
trojan is a WIP
pycat should be fully functional, most testing was done with the windows bind shell as most Hack the Box AV h8s nc.exe these days.
some garnishing code may or may not have been st0len from dodgy chinese forums....
